### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Man
My personal GitHub is dedicated to my work and bug bounty activities. I develop scripts to identify vulnerabilities, successfully discovering numerous security issues for various companies. Through bug bounty programs on platforms like Hackerone and Bugcrowd, I have earned over $100k in bounties.

Previously, I have worked at Fifth Third Bank and Comcast/Xfinity as a Security Engineer, where my responsibilities included managing the company's bug bounty program and identifying vulnerabilities in the company's applications.

While I have scaled back my bug bounty activities to achieve a better work-life balance because I now work as a full-time Security Engineer from 9 to 5, I want to spend my time after 5 PM on other activities rather than just cybersecurity. My passion for cybersecurity remains as strong as ever. In my spare time, I love playing football (soccer), hiking, and spending time with friends.

I primarily use Go and Python for building most of my scanners. While my coding skills aren't at the level of a professional software developer, I am continuously improving and learning to code in my free time.
