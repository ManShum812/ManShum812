### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Man
My personal GitHub is dedicated to my work and bug bounty activities. I develop scripts to identify vulnerabilities, successfully discovering numerous security issues for various companies. Through bug bounty programs on platforms Hackerone and Bugcrowd, I have earned over $100k in bounties.

Previously, I have worked as a Security Engineer, where my responsibilities included managing the company's bug bounty program, identifying vulnerabilities in the company's applications manually using Burp Suite, and using vulnerability scanners such as nuclei or developing scripts to find specific types of vulnerabilities such as reflected XSS, SQL injection, open redirect, and information disclosure, etc.

While I have scaled back my bug bounty activities to achieve a better work-life balance because I now work as a full-time Security Engineer from 9 to 5, I want to spend my time after 5 PM on other activities rather than just cybersecurity. My passion for cybersecurity remains as strong as ever. In my spare time, I love playing football (soccer), hiking, and spending time with friends.
