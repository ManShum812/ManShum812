### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Man
My personal GitHub is dedicated to my work and bug bounty activities. I develop scripts to identify vulnerabilities, successfully discovering numerous security issues for various companies. Through bug bounty programs on platforms like Hackerone and Bugcrowd, I have earned over $100k in bounties.

Previously, I have worked at Fifth Third Bank and Comcast/Xfinity as a Security Engineer, where my responsibilities included managing the company's bug bounty program and identifying vulnerabilities in the company's applications.

While I have scaled back my bug bounty activities to achieve a better work-life balance, my passion for cybersecurity remains as strong as ever. In my spare time, I love playing football (soccer), hiking, and spending time with friends.
